# Data Visualisation Toolkit

This repository organises projects focused on motorsport data visualisation. These tools help analyse lap times, tyre degradation, sector performance, and telemetry data.

## Projects

### 1. [Lap Time Trends Visualiser](#)
Plots lap time trends for drivers across a race to identify performance patterns.

### 2. [Sector Performance Comparator](#)
Compares sector times for multiple drivers to highlight performance differences.

### 3. [Race Strategy Dashboard](#)
An interactive dashboard visualising key race strategy data, including pit stops and tyre degradation.

### 4. [Tyre Degradation Plotter](#)
Visualises tyre wear trends and their impact on lap times.

### 5. [Telemetry Data Visualisation](#)
Analyses and visualises telemetry data, such as throttle, brake, and steering inputs.
